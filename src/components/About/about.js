            UBC Subbots is a student-led team that designs and builds autonomous
            underwater vehicles (AUVs) for the annual RoboSub competition in San
            Diego. We develop systems for navigation, waterproofing,

            engineering and computer science. By building everything from
            scratch, we aim to deepen our learning, improve year over year, and
            equip students with real-world experience in robotics and
            engineering.
